recipeingredient:
- " Cheese Cream"
- "45 grams Cream cheese"
- "1 tsp Lemon juice"
- "1 tsp Milk"
- "60 grams Creme Chantilly"
- " Frozen Raspberries"
- "6 berries Raspberries for the cream"
- "5 berries Raspberries for decoration"
- " Syrup"
- "30 grams Water"
- "10 grams Sugar"
- " Spongecake"
- "1 Egg"
- "40 grams Caster sugar"
- "30 grams Cake flour"
- "1 tbsp Milk"
- "10 grams Butter"
- " Creme Chantilly whipped cream"
- "100 grams Heavy cream"
- "20 grams Granulated sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make the spongecake. Add the egg whites to a bowl. Add the sugar a little at a time while beating with a hand mixer to thoroughly form fluffy peaks."
- "Switch to a rubber spatula, add in the egg yolk, and roughly mix together."
- "Add the sifted powdered ingredients in 4-5 batches and use a rubber spatula to mix it in using a cutting motion without kneading. Add the next batch of powdered ingredients once the previous batch has been just about mixed in."
- "Mix together the milk and butter. Heat in the microwave. Add a little bit of the batter from Step 3."
- "Put the mixture from Step 4 back into the bowl. The batter is complete when the batter drips down like a ribbon."
- "Pour into a parchment paper lined cake mold, tap it against the counter 2-3 times to get rid of air bubbles, and bake for 20-25 minutes at 170°C (or 338 F)."
- "Once it has finished baking, drop it once from a high location right away to get rid of excess air. Remove from the mold, flip it over, and let cool as-is with the parchment paper."
- "Slice off the browned surfaces from the top and sides."
- "Slice and divide into 3 slices. Since it&#39;s a pound cake mold, I think it&#39;s easy to slice. Cut them pretty thinly."
- "Put the syrup ingredients in a container and heat up in the microwave to dissolve the sugar. Set aside to cool."
- "Add the creme Chantilly ingredients to a bowl and whip."
- "Make the cheese cream. In a separate bowl, add the cheese, lemon juice, and milk. Knead to mix well, then mix in 60 g of Step 11."
- "On the slice of spongecake that will be used for the bottom, spread on syrup with a paintbrush and coat with a little bit of Step 11. Place the center slice of cake on top and spread with more syrup."
- "Add crushed raspberries to the remaining creme Chantilly to make a raspberry cream."
- "Spread the raspberry cream on the center cake for the second layer."
- "Top with the last slice of cake and spread on the syrup."
- "Thinly coat with a small amount of the cheese cream."
- "Put the cream in a piping bag and use a Mont Blanc piping tip to pipe onto the cake. Once it&#39;s all assembled, it&#39;s finished. Let cool completely in the refrigerator."
- "Cut into 5 pieces, decorate, and enjoy! It goes very well with strong black coffee."
