recipeinstructions:
- "Slice zucchini on the bias to 1/4&#34; thick slices. Heat chicken broth in a small sauce pan to almost boiling. Reduce heat, keep warm over low heat."
- "In a separate, medium sized sauce pan heat oil and butter over medium high heat. As soon as butter melts add zucchini."
- "Sautée until zucchini just begins to soften. For crisper zucchini remove from pan with slotted spoon to leave oil/butter behind and set aside. For ultra-soft zucchini that will blend into your risotto leave in pan to cook entire time."
- "Add rice to pan. Cook to toast lightly, stirring constantly. About 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium low. Add one cup hot broth. Stir constantly until broth is mostly abdorbed."
- "Add the remaining broth one cup at a time allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding more. When final cup of broth is about 3/4 absorbed reduce heat to low and stir in parmesan."
- "If you removed zucchini from the pan: For medium-soft zucchini return to pan half way through cooking risotto. For firmest texture add with parmesan."
- "Taste before serving. Add salt and pepper if desired (I rarely add any cause the parmesan is usually salty enough). Enjoy!"
