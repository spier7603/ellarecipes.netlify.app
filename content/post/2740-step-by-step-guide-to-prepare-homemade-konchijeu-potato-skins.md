- "1/2 C shredded mozzarella cheese"
- "2 stalks green onion finely chopped"

- " Salt  pepper"
- "2 Tbsp butter melted"

recipeinstructions:
- "Set oven to 400F. Spread potatoes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Use a fork to poke holes in the potatoes (~3 jabs into each potato)."
- "Coat potatoes with olive oil and sprinkle with kosher salt. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour."
- "While waiting for the potatoes, heat a pan over medium high heat. Cook the chopped bacon pieces until crispy and brown. Reserve 2Tbsp of bacon grease and drain bacon pieces on paper towels."

- "Add the reserved bacon grease and melted butter to the bowl of potato scoops and mix. Season with salt and pepper to taste."
- "Scoop potato filling into potato skins to fill about half way (remaining filling is simply mashed potatoes for potato skin haters)."
- "Top each potato skin with konchijeu (as much or or little as you like, I make each potato skin overfilled with konchijeu). Sprinkle 1-2Tbsp cheddar cheese over each potato skin."
- "Place potato skins back into the oven and bake until cheese is melted, about 10min."
- "*If you have enough konchijeu left, you can pour it into a small casserole dish, top with a layer of mozzarella cheese and bake in the oven for 10min. Finish under the broiler for a few minutes until the top is browned and bubbly.**"
