recipeinstructions:
- "First, make the tart base. Let the butter warm up to room temperature and beat with a whisk. Add the sugar and continue to mix. Add the egg yolk and mix again. Lastly sift in the flour and fold in with a rubber spatula. Gather the dough into a ball, wrap with cling film and chill in the refrigerator for 20 minutes."
- "Next, make the calpis cream cheese. Let the cream cheese return to room temperature before beating it with a whisk. Add the sugar, egg yolk, cream and calpis, in that order, while continuing to mix. Sift in the cake flour and fold in with a rubber spatula."
- "Now for the meringue. Add the egg white to a bowl and whisk with a hand mixer. Once white and fluffy, add the sugar in 3 goes, continuing to whisk with each addition. Once stiff peaks form, add the calpis and continue to whisk."
- "On top of some cling film, spread out the tart dough by hand. (Using your hands will result in a more robust tart base that doesn&#39;t crack as easily as if you were to use a rolling pin). Use a rolling pin lightly at the end to get the base nice and even and line a tart pan with it."
- "Cut off the excess dough and press down neatly into the tart pan. Pierce all over with a fork to prevent the dough expanding and let it chill in the refrigerator for 5 minutes. Bake in a preheated oven at 180째C for 10 - 15 minutes."
- "Once baked and cooled, pour in the calpiis cream cheese mixture."
- "Add the meringue to a piping bag and top the tart in any design you like. Bake in an oven at 150째C for roughly 20 minutes."
- "Once it looks like this, it&#39;s ready."
- "So delicious."
- "I used mandarin orange flavoured calpis this time, but you can make it just as well with normal flavoured calpis."
