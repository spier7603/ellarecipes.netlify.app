recipeingredient:
- "6 medium sized potatoes peeled and sliced into 14 slices"
- "1 tsp salt or to taste"
- "1 cup milk"
- "1/2 cup heavy whipping cream"
- "4 tbsp unsalted butter melted"
- "1 tsp nutmeg optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "THERMOMIX DIRECTIONS: place the butterfly attachment in the mixing bowl. Add potatoes, salt, milk, and cream."
- "Place the lid, but leave the measuring cup out. Program 35 minutes / 200F / reverse movement / speed 1"
- "Once the potatoes are cooked, add butter and nutmeg (if using), and program 30 sec. / speed 3. After that, remove the butterfly and program 45 sec. / vel. 5 Done!"
- "STOVETOP DIRECTIONS: place the potatoes in a medium sized pot, add milk, cream, and salt.

- "Once the potatoes are cooked, transfer everything to a mixer or food processor, add butter and nutmeg, and process until desired consistency is reached. I would recommend doing this in batches to avoid overloading the appliance."
- "If you prefer a more &#34;rustic&#34; consistency, you can mash them in the pot using a masher, but it does take a bit longer and you&#39;ll need muscle (these potatoes are not all too soft, since they are cooked a little under the usual doneness)"
- "Done! Serve and top with chives, sour cream, bacon bits, or whatever tickles your fancy. Enjoy!"
