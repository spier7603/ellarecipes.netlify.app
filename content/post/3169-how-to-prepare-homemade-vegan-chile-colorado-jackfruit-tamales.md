- "3/4 cups vegetable shortening melted"
- " You Will Also Need"
- "26 corn husks for medium tamales plus more for steaming"
- "1 medium steamer pot"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepping the husks: Place the corn husk in a large pot and cover with boiling water. Cover and let soak for at least 2 hours. The longer the better. Sometimes I soak mine for overnight and change the water the next day."
- "Prepping the salsa: Remove the stems and seeds from chile ancho, transfer to a pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil then reduce the heat and cook for another 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool for a few minutes."
- "Drain the peppers and transfer them to a blender. Add 1 1/2 cups of vegetable broth, ½ tablespoon oregano, ½ tablespoon of garlic powder, 1/4 tablespoon cumin, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon black pepper (**optional: add ½ tsp of habanero sauce for extra spice). Blend in two batches if needed. Blend until smooth, set aside 1/2 cup to add into the masa dough. You can strain the salsa if you like for a smother texture, I usually don’t though."
- "Prepare the jackfruit: Open and drain can of jackfruit. Slice chunks of jackfruit with a knife and the smoosh with a fork for a shredded meat texture. Finely dice onion. Place vegetable oil and onion on the stove top at medium heat with lid on until the onion is tender and clear. Add Jackfruit, salt, and garlic powder and sauté until jackfruit turns slightly light brown in appearance. Add ½ cup of vegetable broth continue to sauté until broth is absorbed. Add ½ cup of ancho salsa, stir to fully"
- "Prepare the masa: Combine masa harina, baking powder and salt in large bowl, gradually add 2 cups room temperature vegetable broth. Add ½ cup of reserved chile ancho sauce. Using your hands, work into a soft dough. In another glass bowl, melt the shortening in the microwave 30 seconds at a time just until it begins to melt. Add the shortening and remaining 1/2 cup of broth to the masa and work with hands for 7-10 minutes. The masa should have a frosting like texture. If the masa seems too"
- "To assemble tamales: Take a few of the husks at a time, shake off water, if they are more than 4 inches wide, just tear off the side a little. Place the corn husk in the palm of your hand with the wide side closest to you. Spread about 3-4 tablespoons of masa all over the bottom half of husk. Place a heaping 2 tablespoons of filling lengthwise down the center of the tamal. Fold one side in first, then the other side (it should overlap a little on the first fold). Fold down the empty top section"
- "Prepare large pot to steam tamales: Fill the bottom of a large steamer pot with water. Insert the steamer. Arrange all of your tamales standing up (open side up). Take a few extra corn husks and arrange them on top of the filled tamales to help keep them moist while they steam. Turn heat to high to begin steaming, then reduce to medium for the next 90 minutes. After the 45 minutes, check to see if you need to add more water to the steamer. If steam in abundant and you can see water, don’t worry"
