recipeinstructions:

- "Preheat oven to 400°Fahrenheit heat the meatballs in a good sized pan. When browned remove and set aside. Add the Mids Italian sausage sauce to the pan then put in the ground sirloin. Bring to a simmer 20 minutes and stir in the tomato paste. Add the parmesan cheese. Stir in well."
- "Add the olive oil to the eggplant. Cook on a cooking surface. Turn as needed. In a baking pan add some of the eggplant. I used a spring form pan."
- "Add some of the meatballs cut side down. Cover the meatballs with half the sauce. Now add the pesto on top of sauce."
- "Repeat the the same layers except you shouldn&#39;t have pesto on second layer. Add the shredded cheese on top. Put into the oven for 45 minutes."
- "Take out of oven and let rest 15 minutes. Serve I hope you enjoy!!!!"
