recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the pineapple jam.   Separate the core from the pineapple flesh.  Finely slice the core and the flesh.  Transfer onto a sieve over a bowl.  Use the back of a spoon to squeeze out as much juice as humanly can."
- "Reserve the juice for late use.  In a skillet over medium heat, add in the pineapple and 1/3 portion of the juice.  Saute until well combined.  Add in the cinnamon, star anise, cloves and sugar.  Saute until well combined, the sugar has dissolved and most of the liquid has evaporated."
- "Add in the liqueur. Use a burner to flambé. Be very careful while doing this.  Cook until most of the liquid has evaporated.   Add in maltose syrup.  *If the maltose syrup is too sticky and difficult to handle, steam for 5 mins to liquefy.*  Saute until well combined and most of the liquid has evaporated."
- "Add 1/3 of the pineapple juice into the skillet.   Cook until most of the liquid has evaporated.   Repeat the process, until all the pineapple juice has fully incorporated.   Add in orange juice and zest.  Continue cooking until the pineapple jam is dry and sticky."
- "Remove from heat.   Fish out the spices and set aside until cool enuff to handle.  *On a side note, you can add a cup of water to deglaze the skillet. Bring it up to a simmer. Transfer into a cup. Add in a couple of tea bags. You will have a fine pineapple tea.*  Once pineapple jam is cool enuff to handle, divide into 10g each.  Shape each into a ball.  Transfer onto a tray lined with parchment paper and set aside in the fridge until ready to use."
- "Prepare the sablé breton.  In a large mixing bowl, add in butter and sugar.  Using a hand or stand mixer, cream until light and fluffy.  Add in the egg yolks and vanilla paste.  Whisk until well combined."
- "In a smaller bowl, mix flour, salt &amp; baking powder together.  Whisk this flour mixture into the butter mixture, 1/3 portion at a time, until everything is well incorporated.  Continue whisking until it reaches a dough-like texture, not sticky nor stretchy.  Transfer onto a cling film.  Wrap and shape into a rectangle for easier rolling.  Keep chill in the fridge for at least 6 hrs or preferably overnight."
- "Assemble.  Preheat oven to 180 degrees celsius or 360 fahrenheit.   Unwrap the sablé breton onto parchment paper.  Place another parchment paper on top.  Roll into a rectangle to a thickness of 1/4 inch.  *You may have to divide the dough into 2.*"
- "Wack into the oven and bake for 10 mins.  The edges should turn golden brown while the center is still uncooked and soft.  As quickly as you can, use pineapple tart mold or cookie cutter, cut out as many tarts as you can.  And transfer onto another baking tray lined with parchment paper.  *You can bake the leftover dough for another 5-6 mins and consume. I like to blitz them into powder and use it as garnishes for ice cream or any desserts.*"
- "Place the pineapple jam on top.  Brush the tarts as well as the jam very lightly with egg wash.  Wack into the oven and bake for another 6 mins or until the bottom and sides are golden browned.  Remove from oven and set aside to cool down completely."
- "Once cooled, keep in an airtight container.  It will probably last for 5 days at room temperature.  These tarts will taste better the next day."
- "The following steps are optional:  Melt 20g of dark chocolate on a double boiler.  Once the chocolate has completely melted, remove from heat and add in 15g of dark chocolate. This is to temper the chocolate.  The temperature should be around 31 degree celsius or 88 fahrenheit."
- "The chocolate should have a glossy shine and is quite stiff.  Drizzle the tempered chocolate over the pineapple tarts using a fork.  Garnish with some desiccated coconut.  Keep in an airtight container.  It will probably last for 5 days at room temperature."
