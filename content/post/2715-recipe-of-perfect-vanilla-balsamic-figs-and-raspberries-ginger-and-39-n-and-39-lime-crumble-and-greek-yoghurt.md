- "75 grams fine caster sugar"
- "75 grams unsalted butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "Let&#39;s start up with the crumble. Turn up the oven to 175 C. Mix flour and sugar, then add grated ginger and grated lime rind. Find out what quantity works for you, but do use enough, we want fragrant crumble!"
- "Cut up the softened butter into small cubes, add to flour mixture and rub until you have yourself crumble mixture. Spread out on baking sheet and bake in oven for about 15 minutes, or until it looks, and smells, good. Take out and let cool on baking sheet."
- "Put about 250-300 ml of balsamic vinegar (a good, old one, please don&#39;t choose your supermarket&#39;s cheapest!) in a small pot. Add vanilla sugar and boil down until slightly syrupy."
- "Cut the figs in half and marinate in the balsamic syrup. I used a marinade injection needle, but just drizzle it all over and toss lightly if you don&#39;t have that. Drizzle&#39;n&#39;toss the raspberries too"
- "Put raspberries and figs under the oven grill until soft, but not completely mushy. Take out, let cool and cut figs into wedges (aim for 6 wedges per full fig, so three per half). Keep all the juices that came off on the side."
- "Divide the yoghurt over your favorite bowls, spread the fig wedges around the edge, toss in the raspberries, drizzle over the juice left over from grilling."
- "sprinkle over the crumble, grab a spoon and finish bowls to the bottom."
