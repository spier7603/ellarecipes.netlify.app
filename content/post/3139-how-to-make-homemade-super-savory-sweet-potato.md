recipeinstructions:
- "Start microwaveable sweet potatoes to cooking. While they cook, get a small sauce pan and place butter inside and put on low heat."
- "When butter melts, put rosemary, thyme, and onion into butter. Keep the heat low and just let this slowly do its thing for 7-10 minutes. The goal is to extract oils from the herbs, soften the onion, for mixing into the potatoes. You don’t want to cook the veg/herbs, only poach them in the butter."

- "Peel your sweet potatoes, place into a bowl for mixing. You can hand mix these potatoes easily, grab a fork. Add the remaining 1/4 stick of cold butter, and mix well. When the butter is incorporated, add in the butter/cream/herb mix and fold it into the potatoes until incorporated. Salt &amp; Pepper to taste!"
- "Reheat if necessary. Serve, and enjoy:)"
