recipeinstructions:

- "Add all 3 cans of milk and the sugar into the sauce pan and bring to a gentle boil and stir until sugar is dissolved. Add jackfruit and cook for 2 - 3 minutes. In a bowl add the water and slowly stir in the cornstarch. Slowly add slurry, stirring vigorously to avoid clumps. Stir until you get a very thick paste and add to a pan greased with coconut oil. Put in fridge and Let sit for 2 - 3 hrs."
- "Place in freezer for less than an hour before slicing to make it easier. Dont leave in for too long. Then layer and top however youd like and serve."
