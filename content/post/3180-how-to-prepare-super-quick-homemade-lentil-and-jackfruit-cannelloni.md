It&#39;s packed full of flavour from beef, pork and salami too, all baked up. Jackfruit is a great vegetable that has similar fibres to chicken, so is often used as a substitute. The flavours are quite different and most importantly, they… Place cannelloni in prepared baking dish and cover with tomato sauce mixture. One more tip: if you want to use hand-made cannelloni pasta, be sure to cook a few pasta sheets at a time in abundant and salted boiling water, to avoid them to stick together.
