- "After chilling the cheesecake, remove the springform ring. Slice and serve, topped with the raspberry-chocolate sauce. If the sauce is too thick, rewarm it in the microwave for 20 seconds at a time before spooning over the cheesecake."
- "Decorate with remaining chocolate, remaining raspberries and lime curls."
