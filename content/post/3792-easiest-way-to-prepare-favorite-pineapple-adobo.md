- "Add a splash of veg oil to a medium saute pan on medium-high heat. Throw in the pork and fry for about 3 minutes until browned. Remove the pork and add the chicken. Fry for about another 3 minutes. Return the pork to the pan with the chicken."
- "Pour the braising liquid into the pan. Add the garlic, peppercorns, soy sauce and bay leaves. Let simmer for about 2 minutes, then add the pineapple juice and rice vinegar. Simmer uncovered for 30 minutes, or until the chicken is fully cooked, the pork is fork tender, and the sauce is reduced by at least half and slightly thickened. Serve on top of freshly steamed rice."
