recipeinstructions:
- "Allocate an assortment of vegetables."
- "Obelisk the carrot by chopping in two at its bent fulcrum, then flatten the faces. Dice into cubes."
- "Toast base vegetables until lightly brown. Turn off heat."
- "Steam eggplant lightly before adding to wok/pan. It doesn’t take much, you’ll have plenty more steam in the sauce to finish the job."
- "Bread tofu by using two bowls: (One) egg, and (Two) flour, panko, and a fraction corn starch. Stir until evenly distributed. Soak tofu thoroughly in egg, raise up until free of drip, and powder coat before frying. Use tongs to let drip before piling onto wok/pan. (EDIT: This step may also be a little more Chicken Katsu with Panko, but relax! Tofu has protein properties, it’s just that the breading may be simplified by using just egg to coat the triangular slice, too)"
- "Prepare wok sauce by using two bowls: (One) 4 tsp sugar with 1/3 cup water, stir with spoon until dissolved. Add an even mediocre snowy sprinkle of corn starch to the mixture. Mix in, but most importantly, stir directly before adding sauce to wok or pan to ensure consistency. (Two) Soy Sauce, vinegar, salt, and thin layer sesame oil. Combine both into compound mixture."
- "Be generous with sesame oil. Reheat pan/wok to moderate high temperature, evenly stirring delicately. Ensure an even lubricated contents of pan/wok to prevent sticking to the surface. Finally, when pan/wok is hot, pour sauce evenly over contents. Stir on high, evaporating the liquid in the sauce until the corn starch leaves a gooey mixture. Don’t be afraid to add more sesame oil, if needed. Voila!"
