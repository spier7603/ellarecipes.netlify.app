- "When you finish rolling, gently squeeze to set it in place, and place joint-side down. Twist the excess baking parchment at both sides to secure the cake and put it in the fridge to set."
- "Slice off both ends and slice into your desired thickness. And it&#39;s done ♪"
- "Serve onto a plate and enjoy."
