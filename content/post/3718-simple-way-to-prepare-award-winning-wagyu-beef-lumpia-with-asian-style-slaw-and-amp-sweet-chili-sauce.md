- "PREPARING THE FULLBLOOD WAGYU GROUND BEEF MIXTURE In a large bowl, combine the Fullblood Wagyu ground beef, minced sweet onion, minced garlic, minced ginger, sesame oil, minced green onion, grated carrot, kosher salt, and soy sauce. Cover the bowl, and place it in the refrigerator for 2 hours to meld the flavors."
- "PREPARING THE LUMPIA Separate the lumpia wrappers into 5 groups, working with 6 wrappers at a time.Place the lumpia wrappers with the point facing you, so it looks like a diamond. Place 3 tablespoons of the Fullblood Wagyu ground beef mixture 2 inches from the bottom point of the lumpia wrapper. Leave room to fold up the bottom pointed end.Begin by folding the bottom pointed end of wrapper over to cover the meat."
- "Fold in the left and right sides towards the center until the lumpia wrapper resembles an envelope. Fold from the bottom of the lumpia, and roll upwards until you get a small log. Dab your finger in water, and wet the edge of the lumpia wrapper. This will seal the wrapper and keep the log/roll in place.Finish preparing all of your lumpia, and set aside."
- "PREPARING THE ASIAN-STYLE COLESLAW Combine the purple and yellow cabbage (sliced into thin strips) into a bowl.Add the julienned sweet onion to the bowl, as well as the minced green onion.In a separate bowl, combine the dressing ingredients (minced garlic, minced ginger, soy sauce, lemon juice, vegetable oil, sesame oil, rice vinegar, dark brown sugar, and kosher salt). Whisk together the dressing ingredients, and pour the dressing over the cabbage and onions.Toss lightly, and set aside."
- "PREPARING THE SWEET CHILI SAUCE Combine the sugar, rice wine vinegar, 1/2 cup of water, chili paste, crushed garlic, finely grated carrots, and salt in a medi-um saucepan.Bring the ingredients to a boil over high heat. Allow it to boil on high heat for 2 minutes, while stirring occasionally. While this is boiling, whisk or stir together the corn starch and 1/4 cup of water in a small bowl."
- "This is your corn starch mixture.After 2 minutes, slowly pour the corn starch mixture into the boiling mixture on the stove. Stir to combine, and reduce heat to a low boil. Allow it to boil, while stirring frequently, for 2 more minutes. Taste, and add more chili paste if desired. Serve the sauce warm or at room temperature. Note: The sweet chili sauce can be made one week in advance and stored in the refrigerator in a covered container"
- "FINAL STEPS Heat the vegetable oil on medium-high heat in a large stainless steel pan, allowing it to reach a temperature of 360°F. Fry the lumpia in batches of 4 (working in batches prevents the pan from overcrowding, keeps the oil temperature consis-tent, and prevents the lumpia from sticking together).
