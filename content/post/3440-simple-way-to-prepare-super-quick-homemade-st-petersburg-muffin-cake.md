recipeingredient:
- "300 grams Flour"
- "1/2 packages Baking powder"
- "1/3 tsp Soda"
- "1 Vanilla sugar"
- "150 grams Sugar can be increased to 200g"
- "4 Eggs"
- "200 grams Butter"
- "150 grams Sour cream fresh"
- "70 grams Nuts"
- "1 All sort of candied fruits I had glazed cherries dried cranberries dried melon dried papaya dried pineapple"
recipeinstructions:
- "First I cut into small peaces my candied fruits, u can add raisins if u like, but I usually stick to pineapple, papaya, cranberries...."
- "Then I took some nuts, put them in the microwave for less then a minute, gave them some time to cool down, and crushed with an ancient hand grater. U can actually fry the nuts, I just used the easier way."
- "Butter was taken out of the fridge some time ago to be soft, but I forgot to do that, so also melted it a bit in microwave, I had one solid peace, so just some 40 seconds. It anyway started to melt a bit, but while I made things ready it hardened back. I cut it into small peaces for it to continue melting. P.s. Butter shouldn&#39;t be liquid. It&#39;s my little mistake."
- "Sift the flour, with baking powder, soda and vanilla sugar. I do that to add fluffiness"
- "Divide the whites and the yolks .... In the mixer whip the whites with the half of the sugar. Make it a good thick foam. Put in the fridge."
- "Then whip the yolks with the rest of sugar into creamy white texture, add budget, continue mixing and then add sour cream. The texture might seam a bit weird... Don&#39;t whip that for long, otherwise sour cream might loose water and it will become less creamy."
- "Pick a bigger dish and carefully, better with a plastic or wooden spoon mix the whites with the yolk mix. Don&#39;t do it too fanatic, because bit by bit u should start adding flour, and carefully mix. U will hear bubbles of foam ... The dough should be quite sticky. I added all flour in 4 goes. Somewhere between flour I added the fruits and nuts."
- "Smear the form with butter and sprinkle with breaking. Since the dough will be quite thick, u should put it carefully in the form. And don&#39;t try to make it super even, it will anyway melt evenly. And strange step, but even my granny did so, U should cut the dough... Yes, u got me right, just cut that raw dough."
- "Oven must be heated up to 200C. When heated, the cake goes in. And just calm down. I put it on lower place. I watched it, so 25 min it was turned on lower heat, then some 10 on upper+lower, and some 5 minutes on upper for color."
- "I checked it with a wooden stick, if it&#39;s ready. When out, don&#39;t keep it for long in form, so it doesn&#39;t absorb humidity."
