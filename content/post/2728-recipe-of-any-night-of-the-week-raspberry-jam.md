- "100 grams Granulated sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "If you&#39;re able to gather the berries bit by bit, then wash them well. Pat dry with a towel, place into a freezer baggie, and freeze for later. Once you have enough berries, you can make the jam. (If you only want to make a small amount, blast in a microwave.)"
- "Place the raspberries, granulated sugar, and citric acid (lemon juice) into a pot. Mix them in without shaking the pot. Cover and leave for 30 minutes. If using frozen berries, use them as is."
- "The berries will release some juice. Turn the heat to low and start cooking. After 5 minutes, more juice will be released, so stir it up with a wooden spoon. Simmer for 10 minutes while occasionally stirring. (Watch the pot so it doesn&#39;t boil over.)"
- "After Step 4, increase the heat to medium or high heat to let the scum rise to the surface. Remove the scum just once. Use a wooden spoon to stir until it reaches your preferred thickness. While still hot, pour into a sterilized jar and flip it upside down to cool."
- "As it cools, it will thicken even more, so you should stop cooking it while it is still runny. If it seems too watery after it has cooled, boil it again."
- "You should wash the jar well and rinse it with hot, just-boiled water beforehand. The best method might be to boil it. We usually finish ours in a couple of weeks, so I can&#39;t say exactly how long it&#39;ll keep!"
