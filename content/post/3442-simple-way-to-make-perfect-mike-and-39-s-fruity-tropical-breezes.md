recipeinstructions:
- "Feel free to make this recipe as you chose to. Basically, in every 8 to 10 oz of your drink, you&#39;ll have 1+ tbs Greek Coconut Flavored Yogurt, 1 shot of rum, about a 1/4 of a cup of whole milk, a sweetner - or vanilla ice cream - and the rest is entirely up to you. So, get stupid with this recipe girl and make it your own!"
- "In a Magic Bullet or blender, add your ice, fruits, sweeteners and thinners to your tastes. But, 1/2 ice and 1/2 fruits + additions is typical regardless of the size of your blender(s)."
- "Usually, I make a blend of flavors in seperate containers. Or, I take requests from my guests.                                                                      Once fully blended, add your alcohol and mix it in gently by hand. Work it out to at least 1 shot per 8 - 12 oz glass.                                                                                                              Blueberry / Berry Banana, Banana Pineapple Cantelope &amp; Strawberry Orange Mango flavors are pictured below."
- "You can pour these drinks immediately.

Just place your containers back in the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes. Have them set up just slightly then, layer drinks as pictured below. This technique will reduce any chance of early bleeding. Garnish drinks any way you chose."
- "Oh, one small tip. If you want more vibrant colors in your drinks, feel free to add a drop of food coloring to each flavor. I know my friends have no clue I do this since they&#39;re constantly asking me how it is my drinks always look so festive. pfft.....suckers! ;0)"
- "In Memorandum:                                                       I regret to inform you that today, my Magic Bullet, finally bit it&#39;s own magic bullet. So, I was forced to move on and use an ancient, more pedestrian blender."
- "Believe it or not, this was the exact moment he passed on.                                                                RIP little buddy. RIP. :0("
