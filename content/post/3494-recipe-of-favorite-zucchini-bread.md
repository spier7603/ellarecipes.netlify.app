- " Eggs"
- " Canola Oil"
- " Brown Sugar"
- " Baking Powder"
- " Baking Soda"
- " Grated Nutmeg"

- " Grated Ginger"
- " Allspice"
- " Vanilla Extract"
- " Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Whisk together all dry ingredients including nutmeg and ginger. Crack three eggs in a bowl and add a splash of vanilla extract."
- "Wash your zucchini and chop off the ends. Mix together the oil and eggs with the dry ingredients to create a batter. I am going to recommend cooking in cast iron if you have it. Butter your pan very well and place in preheated 375 F oven for about 7 Minutes. Shred the zucchini with the assistance of a food processor or manually. Fold it into the batter. (I was alarmed at first. The batter looked too thick. Fear not. The zucchini will begin to release liquid and the batter will lose viscosity."
- "When you’ve finished folding, use a large spoon and fill each cavity about half way. If you’re using a loaf pan or any other type of baking vessel, just don’t fill it more than half way. It will rise while baking by roughly 20%."
- "I baked these mini loafs for 21 minutes and it was good for me. If you’re using another which will contain all of the batter, I suggest checking it after 25 minutes followed by 5 minute intervals. It will take longer to bake when it is all in one pan. By dividing it, I achieved a shorter cooking time. Plus, the warm cast iron pan gives you a head start."
- "Because you buttered your pan so well, should pop right out of pan. If you opted to use another type of pan, you can always line it with parchment paper to ensure that it will come out. I tried to make some kind of cool tower but, I’ve got no shame in my zucchini brick. Hahaha. They say you can have it with cream cheese. I say cream cheese and smoked salmon would be better. Anyway, zucchini in your bread doesn’t mean you’re deranged. Enjoy."
