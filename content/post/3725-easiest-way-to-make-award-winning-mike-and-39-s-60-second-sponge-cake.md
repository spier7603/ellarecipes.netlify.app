recipeinstructions:
- "° Mix everything in the Microwave Sponge Cake section with whisk.                                  ° Leave no lumps."
- "Spray your ramakins with an olive oil or butter spray."
- "° Fill ramakins 1/2 way to their tops.           ° Cover ramakins tightly with cling wrap.                                                                    ° Poke 4 holes in the cling wrap with a toothpick."
- "° One ramakin at a time - microwave each cake for 55 to 60 seconds. ° Check at 50 seconds on your first try. ° 55 seconds consistently does the trick for me in a newer 1100 watt microwave."
- "° While sponge cake is still warm, using the blade of a butter knife - gently pull cake from your ramakins sides.                                                                                                                                                   ° Turn ramakins over and gently release your cakes on to a plate and allow them to cool covered with cling wrap. These cakes will dry out quickly if not covered."
- "Break these cakes up in pieces or dish your cakes up any way YOU desire. Get creative!"
- "° You can use a self rising flour but know it will create a smoother cake finish [see last photo below] than the AP flour would. It&#39;s the AP flour that gives this cake it&#39;s spongy look. However, the absorbency and sweet taste are ultimately identical with self rising.                                                                                                                                                                                       ° If choosing to use a larger ramakin as pictured below, you&#39;ll need to microwave for about 90 seconds + until cake is done."
- "° If you&#39;re interested in the Strawberry Shortcake and sauce pictured above: It&#39;s 10 large crushed strawberries, water [as needed], Sugar In The Raw or sugar [to taste] and 1/4 tsp lemon zest.                                                                         ° There&#39;s also a large dollop of high end - quality Strawberry Jam at the base of each glass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ° Mix 1 tablespoon corn starch + 1 teaspoon water very well and add it to your simmering strawberries to thicken your sauce - if desired.                                                            ° Drizzle sauce over sponge cake.                                                        ° Add sliced fresh strawberries and Cool Whip to taste."
