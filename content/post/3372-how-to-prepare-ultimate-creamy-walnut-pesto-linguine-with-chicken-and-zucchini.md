recipeingredient:
- " walnut halves"
- " packed cup basil leaves"
- " garlic"
- " freshly grated parmesan cheese"
- " extra virgin olive oil"
- " chicken breast halves"
- " zucchini cut into 12 in slices and quartered"
- " dry linguine"
- " whipping cream"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put a small pan on medium heat and add the walnuts. Let the nuts toast for 2 minutes, shaking the pan often to move them around. Add the nuts to a food processor along with the basil, garlic, parmesan and olive oil. Add a pinch of salt and pulse a dozen or so times until the pesto reaches a uniform and just slightly chunky consistency."
- "Cover the chicken breasts between sheets of cling film or parchment paper. Use a kitchen mallet, rolling pin or small heavy pot to pound the breasts until they&#39;re 1/2 to 3/4 inch thickness."
- "Add a splash of veg oil to a large pan on medium-high heat. Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper and sear them in the pan, about 4 to 5 minutes per side depending on thickness. Remove the chicken to a plate to rest and wipe the pan clean. You&#39;ll need it again shortly. Put a large pot of salted water on high heat for the pasta."
- "Put the pan back on high heat and add a fresh splash of veg oil. Add the zucchini and fry until they start to caramelize and soften just a little, about 3 or 4 minutes. Season with salt and freshly cracked pepper. While you&#39;re cooking the zucchini, cook the linguine according to the package directions."
- "Drag the cooked pasta from the pot to a large mixing bowl. Add 3 or 4 tablespoons of pesto as well as the cream, then toss to coat. If the pasta&#39;s too thick, add a ladle or so of the pasta cooking water. Plate the linguine, and top with the chicken breast and zucchini."
- "Transfer any leftover pesto to a small container and top with a little extra virgin olive oil. Keep it in the fridge to be used again. Hint: it&#39;s amazing drizzled inside an omelette with a little cream cheese."
