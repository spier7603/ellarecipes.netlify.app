recipeingredient:
- "4 mandarin oranges worth Tankan mandarin orange peels"
- "1 Cointreau"
- "1 Whatever chocolate you like"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the tankan into sixths and eat the fruit. Then take the peels and soak in water. You can also drain them and then store in the freezer."
- "Dip the peels 3 times into the boiling water. Then put them into cold water to soak while skimming off any scum. You can decrease the number of times you dip it and the amount of time you soak it, but it will be more bitter, so adjust to your liking."
- "With a spoon, remove the fibers and pith."
- "Cut the peels into a desired width. It&#39;s easier to cut if you use a pizza cutter. After cutting, soak in water until soft and wash them."
- "Combine the peels and sugar into a pot. Heat up on low heat and add in just enough water to cover the peels. Boil for 20 minutes."
- "When most of the water has evaporated, be careful not to burn it. Pour in the desired amount of Cointreau and cook it till the alcohol evaporates."
- "Arrange the peels so they aren&#39;t too heavy in one spot on top of paper towels or a colander or sieve. Sprinkle sugar on top (not listed in ingredients) and let them dry for 1 day."
- "Melt the chocolate in a double boiler or the microwave and then dip the peels in it. Return them to the paper towels and once the chocolate hardens they are done!"
- "These were easier to make than I thought. The deliciousness of these will leave you quite satisfied. I just can&#39;t think of throwing away these peels when they turn out so yummy like this. Tankan peels are the best."
- "Using spray-type Cointreau Cuisine right before dipping in the chocolate gives them a nice aroma."
