recipeingredient:
- " Cake"
- "1 1/2 Cups Flour"
- "1 Cup Butter"
- "1 Cup Sugar"
- "1/2 Tsp. Baking Powder"
- "4 Eggs"
- "1/2 Cup Sour Cream"
- "Pinch Salt"
- "Splash Vanilla Extract"
- " Fruit  Caramel"
- "1 Ripe Pineapple"
- " Maraschino Cherries"
- "3/4 Cup Brown Sugar"
- "1/4 Cup Butter"
- "Splash Cherry Juice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 360 F. Whisk together the dry ingredients."
- "Prepare your pineapple. Be sure to cut deep enough so you get the eyes out. They will make your throat itchy if you don’t. Quarter the pineapple. Slice across the top and remove the tough and fibrous core."
- "Slice pineapples and set aside."
- "Make the caramel by melting about 1/4 cup butter in an oven proof pan (I used cast iron). Add in the brown sugar, a splash of the cherry juice and stir over medium low heat."
- "When it starts getting good and bubbly, turn it off and remove from the stove. Place pineapples into the hot caramel as nicely as you can. Fill in any spaces with the cherries."
- "Cream together the sugar and butter. Add in eggs one at a time and combine with each addition. Add in dry ingredients and combine throughly. Lastly, add in sour cream and combine. Pour over the pineapples and cherries."
- "Bake for 35 minutes and give it a check. Its done when it becomes golden in color on top and a toothpick can come out clean from the cake potion of the cake. (Ignore those muffins, they’re in the strawberry rhubarb recipe)."
- "Let the cake cool down for 10-15 minutes before flipping onto a cake plate. You want the caramel to set a little bit but not too much. If you flip it out too soon, it’ll be pineapple soup. Too late and you just wont get it out."
- "Mint was the weapon of choice for the garnish. Really, it looks a lot better than it should. It should be illegal... that’s why I was so drawn to this cake. I hope you enjoy."
