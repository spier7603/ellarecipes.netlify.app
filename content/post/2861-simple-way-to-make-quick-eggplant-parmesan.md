recipeinstructions:
- "Slice eggplants. Not too thick, not too thin. Just right will be nice. Salt generously on both sides. Drain on a rack for 60 minutes. Rinse eggplants and dry throughly with paper towel."
- "Set up your breading station. I’ll tell you a secret... I forgot to season the eggplants. So, I seasoned them after I fried them and it was fine. You can choose to season them as you wish."
- "Preheat your oven to 400 F and start getting your oil hot while you’re breading the eggplant. Drop those bad boys in and let them fry until golden on both sides. It’ll take a few minutes each side. Those potato flakes hold up well in the oil. Drain on a rack over paper towels."
- "Put down about 1 1/2 cups sauce in a large sheet pan. Strategically place eggplant on top of sauce. If you’re lucky, they’ll fit nice. If not, jam them in. Give a healthy dose of Parmesan (fresh if possible) then cheddar."
- "Place in oven for roughly ten minutes or until cheese has melted to your satisfaction. *Some recipes will have you ladle sauce on the eggplant prior to placing it in the oven. You can, if you want to sacrifice crispness."
- "Serve over pasta of your choice. I had a huge pot of sauce that I made prior. You’ll have to account for extra sauce to sauce your pasta. Garnish with green onion and freshly shredded cheese."
