recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare a sterilized glass jar with an airtight lid. Peel the oranges, and separate into single sections. Put all of the ingredients (2 oranges, 2 tablespoons honey, and water) into the jar. The next step is to shake the jar once a day, or stir it with a stir stick, open the lid and smell it."

- "Store in jar. I store it in the crisper drawer of my refrigerator. It should be used up within a month."
- "If you leave 1 spoonful of the liquid yeast and add it to a new jar of mixture, it should fizz up within 24 hours.  Just add 1 mandarin orange, 2 tablespoons honey, water and 1 tablespoon of the liquid yeast."
