recipeinstructions:
- "Grate all vegetables after washing them in water. Finely chop Cilantro. Set aside."
- "Take Wheat flour in a large bowl and add one TBLS of oil and mix along with 1/2 TS salt. Did all the spices mentioned in ingredients along with Rice powder and salt to taste and prepare a hard dough. The moisture in the vegetables was sufficient for me to prepare a stiff dough.

- "Heat Tawa and place the rolled Paratha. Flip after a minute and and apply Oil / Ghee of your choice and flip the other side and apply Oil. Flip and cook till light brown spots appear on the Paratha, indicating that it is well cooked. Keep the flame low/ medium heat to allow uniform cooking of the veggies inside."
- "Serve them hot with Pickle and Curd. Goes well as a lunchbox dish easy to pack and carry. Healthy and tasty."
- "Want to enjoy with side dishes add a simple Dal or to have a delicious side dish prepare as I did, with Bellpepper Mushroom subzi."
