recipeingredient:
- "3 Large Ripe Mangos"
- "10-12 Kiwis"
- " Red Grapes"
- " Rice Paper Wraps"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut all fruit first before prepping the rice paper wraps. Cut the mangos into spears and set aside. Slice the kiwis in half,and use a spoon to separate the skin from the fruit. For the red grapes,they are to be sliced in half to help them keep from rolling out of the wrap."
- "Place all fruit in a bowl and mix until fruit is evenly spread throughout. Set aside."
- "For the rice paper wraps, take a curved plate and fill it slightly with water. Take a rice wrap and slowly sumberge it. Hold it under the water for 15 to 20 seconds."
- "The wraps feel slimy at first, but they will get tacky and sticky after excess water is removed. Place the wrap on a tea cloth (we used paper towels) and dab it gently to remove the excess water. Lift the wrap off the tea cloth and place it on a hard flat surface for folding."
- "Begin spooning the fruit mix into the center of the wrap. It should be tacky and self adhesive by this point, so just fold it over until all the fruit is covered and secure."
- "Finish making the rest of the wraps, and they can be garnished with a little bit of confectioners sugar on top to make it extra sweet!"
