recipeingredient:
- " Muffin Batter"
- "150 grams Cake flour"
- "100 grams Philadelphia Cream Cheese"
- "100 grams Margarine"
- "100 grams Sugar"
- "1 Egg Medium"
- "1 Egg yolk"
- "1 lemon worth Lemon Zest"
- "1 tbsp Milk"
- "1 tbsp Orange curaao"
- "1 tsp Baking powder"
- " For the filling"
- "100 grams Philadelphia Cream Cheese"
- "100 grams Raspberries or blueberries"
- "1 tbsp Sugar adjust depending on the sweetness"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the cake flour and baking powder. Let margarine and eggs warm to room temperature. Cut the cream cheese in half and let half warm to room temperature. Cut that half into 6-8 pieces."
- "Grate the lemon peel. The white part is bitter, so be sure to just grate the surface lightly."
- "Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of sugar over the raspberries. Take a few for decorating out of the 100 gram portion. Beat the egg in a separate bowl."
- "In a separate bowl, begin whipping the butter with a whisk. Mix in the sugar, a third at a time, until the mixture has a fluffy texture."
- "Mix in the egg, a third at a time. Mix well. (This can be done with a hand mixer)."
- "Mix in the cream cheese. Once the mixture is smooth, add milk, liquor, and lemon zest."
- "Sift the flour once more and then add to the bowl in 3 batches. Using a rubber spatula, fold the flour in lightly."
- "Add the raspberries before the flour is completely mixed in. Its best to add them before they completely thaw."
- "Mix gently so as not to crush the berries. Stop once you start to get a marbled look to the batter."
- "Use a spoon to scoop the batter into a muffin pan. Fill half the cup with batter, add the cream cheese mixture, then cover with more batter."
- "Use the raspberries you set aside earlier to decorate the muffins. Preheat the oven to 170°C and bake for 25-30 minutes. If you are using a silicone muffin pan, bake for about 30 minutes at 180°C."
- "Once they have cooled a little, transfer the muffins to a rack. Once cool, they can be wrapped to prevent from drying out."
- "Because of the cream cheese, these always turn out soft and moist."
- "And the center is full of cream cheese! You could dice the cream cheese and mix into the batter."
- "They are perfect for presents, too. If you use a silicone pan, they won&#39;t burn, so you can bake them on high temperature."
- "This recipe uses a whole 200 g block of the Philadelphia Cream Cheese. You could top the muffins with the cream cheese and bake them as well."
- "The egg yolk doesn&#39;t vary much between medium and large so either would work. However, if you use a whole large egg, there is more white and it will make the butter separate, so be careful."
- "You can also just cut the cream cheese into bite-sized pieces and mix it into the batter. Mix in at Step 8."
