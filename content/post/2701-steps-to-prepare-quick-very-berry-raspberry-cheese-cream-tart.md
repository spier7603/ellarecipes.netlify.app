- "Thoroughly mix the cream cheese and sugar together in a bowl. It&#39;s easier to use a rubber spatula to rub the sugar into the butter to start with."
- "Beat the mixture with a whisk until creamy. Add the sour cream and mix well."

- "If you try to defrost the frozen berries, they become too mushy and soft because of the moisture, so please use fresh berries if you can."
- "Use nappage (glaze) that doesn&#39;t require heating up to coat the berries.  If you use glazed berries like this as topping, they are easy to fix in place since they don&#39;t roll around."
- "If you have any leftover filling, pour into a cup and top with berries. So cute."
- "This is what it looks like when cut. Unfortunately I&#39;m not good at slicing, so it looks messy. No matter how many times I cut cakes, I never seem to improve..."
