- "4% salt water solution is 4 tablespoons kosher salt to 4 cups water. Non-chlorinated and no fluoride in water. Now you won&#39;t need this much unless you are making a bunch of this stuff. So 1 tablespoon kosher or pink Himalayan salt to 1 cup water. If using table grind salt use 1 teaspoon to 1 cup. Add the spices and mix well. Add the spice mix well. Heat the water to dissolve the salt in the water."

Do this for at least 2 weeks to ferment. When you open skim the top to remove anything that should not be there. I hope you enjoy!!!!"
