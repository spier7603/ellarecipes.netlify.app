recipeingredient:
- "200 grams Raspberry pure sweetened"
- "250 ml Milk"
- "150 ml Heavy cream"
- "30 grams Granulated sugar"
- "2 Egg yolks"
- "1 tbsp Kirsch"
- "10 grams Powdered gelatin"
- "3 tbsp Water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preliminaries: If the raspberry purée is frozen, defrost and bring to room temperature. Mix the gelatin and water to soften."
- "Put egg yolks and granulated sugar in a bowl. Beat well with a whisk until it&#39;s pale yellow and smooth."
- "Add milk little by little while beating. When it&#39;s well incorporated, transfer the mixture to a small pot. Cook over low heat for 5 to 6 minutes while mixing."
- "Use a wooden or silicone spatula. If you don&#39;t keep mixing, the bottom and sides will solidify. When the custard has thickened, turn off the heat."
- "Add the softened gelatin and mix well to dissolve."
- "Strain the custard through a sieve into a large bowl. (This is to make it easier to combine with the cream.) Stir while suspending the bowl over a ice water to cool."
- "Add the raspberry puree and kirsch to the custard and mix well. Move the rubber spatula from side to side and blend everything together completely."
- "When it&#39;s well mixed, add the cream."
- "Put the cream in another bowl and whip until it&#39;s airy and creamy. (It should fall in a thick stream from the whisk when you lift it up.)"
- "Add the whipped cream to the Step 8 mixture. Mix up from the bottom and from the sides with the rubber spatula to incorporate."
- "It&#39;s easier to mix if you tilt the bowl a little. When it&#39;s well blended, pour into molds."
- "Pour into molds, and chill until set in the refrigerator, about 3 to 4 hours. Optionally serve with fresh cream or berries."
- "To remove the mold, dip the container in hot water for a few seconds and the contents will come out easily."
- "I added a bit of extra gelatin so that it separate from the mold easily, but if you prefer a softer texture, you can reduce the gelatin to 7 g."
