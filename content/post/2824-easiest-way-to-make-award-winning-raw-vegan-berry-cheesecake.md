- " Filling"
- "1 1/2 cups raw cashews quicksoak by covering the cashews with boiling hot water soak uncovered for 30 minutes then drain"

- "1/2 cup maple syrup"
- "2/3 cup fullfat coconut milk or coconut cream"
- "3/4 cup raspberries"
- "1 teaspoon hibiscus powder optionalmakes a brilliant pink color"
- "3/4 cup blueberries"
- "2 teaspoon blue butterfly pea flower powder optionalmakes a vibrant blue color"
- "3/4 cup blackberries"
recipeinstructions:
- "If using springform pans: Wrap one 9-inch or 4 4-inch springform pans with 1-2 layers of aluminum foil, covering the bottom and the sides. Lightly coat the bottoms and sides with coconut oil. Cut a circle of parchment paper for the bottom of the pan. Place about ½ cup of the crust mixture in each the 4” pans (or all of it for the 9” pan) and pack down tightly with the bottom of a glass or back of a spoon (the glass works best). Place in the freezer to firm up while you make the filling."
- "If using cupcake tins: Line cupcake tins with parchment paper. Press paper down into the tin using a small measuring cup or the bottom of a glass. Place about 2 tablespoons of the crust mixture in the parchment paper “cups” and pack down tightly with the bottom of a measuring cup, the bottom of a glass, or back of a spoon. Place in the freezer to firm up while you make the filling."
- "To make the crust:  • Add dates to a food processor or blender until it turns into paste and forms into a ball. Remove and set aside.  • Next, blend the walnuts into a coarse meal. Add dates and maca (if using) to the nut meal and blend until a chunky dough forms, which holds together when you squeeze it between your fingers.**"
- "Add all filling ingredients, except berries, hibiscus powder, and blue butterfly pea flower powder, to a blender and mix until very smooth. I had to blend it for a while in my regular blender, but if you have a Vitamix, this part of the process should go quickly. If the mixture doesn’t look completely smooth, you can add a bit more coconut milk."
- "Set aside two cups of the filling."
- "Add the raspberries and hibiscus (if using) to the filling that remains in the blender. Blend until the color is uniform."
- "Divide the raspberry filling evenly among the tins or pans. Tap a few times to release any air bubbles and even out the filling."
- "Place 1 cup of filling in the blender and add the blueberries and blue butterfly pea powder (if using). Blend until the color is uniform."
- "Divide the blueberry filling evenly among the tins or pans. Tap a few times to release any air bubbles and even out the filling."
- "Place the remaining cup of filling in the blender and add the black raspberries. Blend until the color is uniform."
- "Divide the black raspberry filling evenly among the tins or pans. Tap a few times to release any air bubbles and even out the filling."
- "Freeze until firm."
- "Remove from freezer, and pop the cakes out of the tins or pans and place on plates. Allow to sit at room temperature before serving – 10 minutes for cupcakes, 20 minutes for 4” or 9” cakes. Make sure they don’t sit too long or they will get mushy."
- "The cakes, if removed from the tins or pans and placed in an airtight container, will keep in the refrigerator for 2-3 days, or the freezer for up to 2 weeks."
