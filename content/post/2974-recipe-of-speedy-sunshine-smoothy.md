recipeingredient:
- " Sunshine Smoothy"
- "2 cup ice cubes"
- "1 cup orange juice or OJ concentrate"
- "1 cup vanilla ice cream"
- "1 cup pineapplecannedfreshor frozen"
- "1 cup mandarin oranges"
- "1/2 cup half and half or milk"
- "2 tbsp sugar optional"
- "1 tbsp vanilla extract optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add everything to blender with ice cubes being last.  (I use a ninja, they are great for smoothies)"
- "Blend to desired consistency adding more or less of any ingredients for your desired consistency."
- "This recipe can be tweaked many different ways for all kinds of different fruit flavored smoothies."
- "I enjoy using different mixed drink flavored &#34;mixers&#34; as my liquid either with or without OJ in the recipe.  I keep several different mixed drink &#34;mixers&#34; such as Daily brand peach daiquiri or margarita mix on hand. I also use Strawberry or Banana mixed drink purees/concentrates. Any grocery store or liquor store usually carries 2 common brands which are &#34;Daily and Finest Call&#34;.  They are alcohol free and sold as the mix for blending drinks but work great to add variety of flavor to smoothy recipes."
- "This recipe is also great just using frozen fruit and any liquid of choice such as OJ. With frozen fruit you don&#39;t even need to add ice cubes.  Some of my favorite ingredients are mixed frozen fruit with OJ and a little milk.  Do you know that frozen fruit and milk blended in the blender makes ice cream. Use your imagination and have fun. My recipe makes a full blender but after I pour a tall refreshing smoothy, i simply put the blender pitcher in the freezer and simply remove from freezer and thaw a bit, when i want another refreshing drink. The recipe above is a great base recipe and is such a refreshing tropical orange flavored drink. I like it as well as a orange Julius or a McDonald&#39;s Smoothy. ENJOY!"
