- "1/4 tsp cayenne pepper"
- "1 clove chopped garlic"
- " Topping"
- " Grated cheese"
- " Chili flakes"
- "1 little bit of Chopped green onion"
- " Breadcrumbs"
recipeinstructions:
- "BBQ or Bake the russet potatoes by wrapping them in aluminum foil, poking them 5-10 times with a fork, then putting them in the oven/bbq for 30 mins @ 350. They are good when they are soft inside"
- "While the potatoes are baking, make mashed potatoes: with the other 2 potatoes, peel them, chop into cubes, then boil in salted water for about 15 mins. They are good when you can mash one with a fork. You could skip this and just use the insides of the baked potatoes, but it won’t have the surprising softness and smoothness that we love in a loaded potato"
- "While those potatoes are boiling, make the meat: in a large frying pan on Med-High, cook the meat. As each meat finishes, take it out of the pan and set aside. Leave the juices in the pan"
- "Add the vegeatables to the pan and cook for about 10 mins… This is a good opportunity to season with salt pepper, and a bit of cayenne"
- "When the mashed potatoes are ready, drain the water then put them back in the pot. Add the Potato Mashing Ingredients (milk, butter, Boursin, salt/pepper, etc…) and stir. Try and get it nice and smooth"
- "The baked potatoes are probably done now. Take them out of the oven/bbq and place in the fridge/freezer for 5 mins to cool. This will make them easier to cut."
- "Add the meat and veggies to the mashed potatoes. Taste it, season it, taste it, season it, etc…"
- "Cut the baked potatoes in half along the long side, then scoop out the middle, making sure to not break the potato skin"
- "Add the scooped out potato to the mashed potato mixture. Mix it lightly, but don’t stir too much. Russet potatoes are quite starchy so if you stir them too much it will turn gluey."
- "The fun part you’ve been waiting for: Fill the potato skins with your mashed potato mixture. Use a heaping amount. It should look a little “extra”"
- "Top with the grated cheese, breadcrumbs, chili flakes, green onions, then broil on high for 3 mins/until crispy and golden"
- "Eat…. It is delicious"
