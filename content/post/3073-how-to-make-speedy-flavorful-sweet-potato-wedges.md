- " chopped fresh rosemary"
- " sea salt"
- " honey"
- " crumbled goat cheese"

recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 400F/200C. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, lightly grease with Extra Virgin Olive Oil from Spain and set aside."
- "In a large mixing bowl, toss together sweet potato wedges, Extra Virgin Olive Oil from Spain, rosemary and sea salt until sweet potatoes are evenly coated."
- "Arrange sweet potatoes on prepared baking sheet in an even layer, making sure the wedges don’t touch (this will prevent them from steaming and will be crispier as a result). Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, turning the baking sheet once, or until the sweet potatoes are fully cooked, tender inside and crispy to your liking on the outside (taste one to make sure!)"
- "In the meantime, prepare the candied pecans. Prepare a sheet of baking paper on your kitchen counter. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Place the pecans in a single layer and toast until fragrant. Always keep an eye on the pecans because they can burn very quickly."
- "When the pecans are toasted, add the maple syrup and a pinch of salt, and stir to coat the pecans. Cook for an additional 30 to 45 seconds, stirring constantly to make sure it doesn&#39;t burn. Spread the pecans on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer and let cool."
- "When the sweet potatoes are cooked, remove from the oven, drizzle with honey, sprinkle with crumbled goat cheese and candied pecans. Season with freshly cracked pepper and serve immediately."
